# hackmaster5e-fvtt

Hackmaster for Foundry. Some rough edges here and there, but this should do what you need. Don't fret if the repo goes quiet. If I vanish, I will be back sooner than later.

## Roadmap

##### 0.2.x: Combat Competency
Better support for the various particulars of combat in Hackmaster. Combat moves, smarter defense rolls, status effects, initiative manipulation, fatigue, and encumbrance.

##### 0.3.x: Inventory and Talents
A proper, nested inventory system with containers, proper weight management, and more. Better talents which will alter a character's behavior without needing to manually tune miscellanious bonuses.
