# hackmaster5e-fvtt

Hackmaster for Foundry. Some rough edges here and there, but this should do what you need. This project is on temporary hiatus. Developer gone fishing, but will be back in a couple of months. I Promise!

## Roadmap
##### 0.3: Inventory and Talents
A proper, nested inventory system with containers, proper weight management, and more. Better talents which will alter a character's behavior without needing to manually tune miscellanious bonuses.

##### 0.4: Magic and Weapon Effects
Automatic tracking and handling of spell effects, poisons, and damage types.
