# hackmaster5e-fvtt

Hackmaster for Foundry. Some rough edges here and there, but this should do what you need. Don't fret if the repo goes quiet. If I vanish, I will be back sooner than later.

## Roadmap
##### 0.3: Inventory and Talents
A proper, nested inventory system with containers, proper weight management, and more. Better talents which will alter a character's behavior without needing to manually tune miscellanious bonuses.

##### 0.4: Magic and Weapon Effects
Automatic tracking and handling of spell effects, poisons, and damage types.
